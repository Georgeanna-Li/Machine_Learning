# Machine-Learning

- Supervised machine learning:
  - Basic machine learning concepts such as data splitting, cross-validation, generalization error, overfitting, the fundamental trade-off, the golden rule, and data preprocessing. 
  - Common machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, $k$-nearest neighbours, SVMs, naive Bayes, and logistic regression.

- Feature and Model Selection:
  - Evaluation metrics for classification and regression, feature engineering, feature selection, feature importances, ensembles, and regularization.
