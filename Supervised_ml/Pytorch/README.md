This is realated to deep learning, with a focus on NLP problems and applications. 

Overall purposes are:
- Identify the core principles of training and designing artificial neural networks
- Identify the inherent ambiguity in natural language, and appreciate challenges associated with teaching machines to understand and generate it
- Understand the major deep learning methods developed for solving NLP problems
- Apply deep learning methods to NLP problems in critical, creative, and novel ways


HOW TO RUN THE NOTEBOOK:
- For seq2seq_tutorial_BLEU.ipynb, you have to push that up to Google colab and download corresponding corpus file from the github indicated in the markdown. Generally expect 20~ min to run on GPU.
